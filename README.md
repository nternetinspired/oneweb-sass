#Oneweb - A fat-free Sass framework

Oneweb is a lightweight Sass framework, built with OOCSS principles in mind and an eye to maintainability, scalability and ease of customisation. It's the starting point for each of my own projects and enables me to build sites faster than with any other framework I've tried (which is a lot).

Oneweb is platform-agnostic and intended to be installed, using Bower. It's far better than, and will shortly replace, the Sass framework currently powering https://github.com/nternetinspired/OneWeb

## Is Oneweb right for you?

Possibly not. Oneweb is intended to be used by people who:

1. Understand html and css at a fairly high level.
2. Are familiar with the basics of Sass.
3. Know how to use Google to answer their questions about either of the above.
4. Have no expectation of any right to free support from the author.

## Issues
If you find something wrong or have some suggestions how Oneweb can be improved, please use Github's issue reporting features or submit a pull request. If you email me with such things you will be ignored.
