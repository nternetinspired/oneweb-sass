#Oneweb - A fat-free Sass framework

Oneweb is a lightweight Sass framework, built with OOCSS principles in mind and
an eye to maintainability, scalability and ease of customisation. It's the
starting point for each of my own projects and enables me to build sites faster
than with any other framework I've tried (which is a lot).

Oneweb is designed to be platform-agnostic. It's far better than, and will
shortly replace, the Sass framework currently powering [Oneweb](http://joomlafuture.com/).

## Is Oneweb right for you?

Possibly not. Oneweb is intended to be used by people who:

1. Understand html and css at a fairly high level.
2. Are familiar with the basics of Sass.
3. Know how to use Google to answer their questions about either of the above.
4. Have no expectation of any right to free support from the author.

## Installation

There are three ways to include oneweb-sass in your project

- Install with [Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install oneweb-sass` (recommended).
- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/nternetinspired/oneweb-sass/archive/master.zip).
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/nternetinspired/oneweb-sass.git`.
